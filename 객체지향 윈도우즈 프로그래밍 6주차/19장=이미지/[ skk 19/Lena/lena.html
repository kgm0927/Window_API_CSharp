Twenty-five years ago, an unknown technician scanned in Miss November 1972's centerfold, 
and "the Lena image" went on to become the industry standard for judging imaging technology.
Last month, Playmate Lena Sj&ouml;&ouml;blom-Soderberg (left, with Dr. James Owens of Eastman Kodak) 
attended the 50th anniversary conference of the Society for Imaging Science and Technology in Cambridge, Mass., 
where she was hailed as the <a href=http://www-2.cs.cmu.edu/~chuck/lennapg/playboy_backups/lena.html>
"First Lady of the Internet."</a>

For the curious: 'lena' or 'lenna' is a digitized Playboy centerfold,
from November 1972. (Lenna is the spelling in Playboy, Lena is the
Swedish spelling of the name.) Lena Soderberg (ne Sj&ouml;&ouml;blom) was last
reported living in her native Sweden, happily married with three kids
and a job with the state liquor monopoly.  In 1988, she was
interviewed by some Swedish computer related publication, and she was
pleasantly amused by what had happened to her picture.  That was the
first she knew of the use of that picture in the computer business.

Lena 영상을 처음 사용한 곳은 Southern California 대학에서의 디지털 영상 압축 연구로 알려지고 있다.
그리고 지금도 “Lenna”이미지를 계속 사용하고 있는 이유 중 하나는 ,
영상처리 연구의 테스트 영상으로 아주 적절한 
특징(nice mixture of detail, flat regions,shading, and texture)들을 
가지고 있기 때문이다.
